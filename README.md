# Microplastic-Dretector
The Microplastic Detection System identifies and measures microplastics in water using an Arduino-based laser scattering method. As a laser passes through the sample, particles scatter light, which sensors detect and the Arduino analyzes. This portable, low-cost system offers real-time, eco-friendly water quality monitoring.
